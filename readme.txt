GENERAL INFO
This is code I wrote as part of our Calculus 2 project for estimating areas under curves. It was written in Python.
PROJECT INFO
This program that calculates Riemann Sums for polynomial functions given an upper limit, lower limit, number of rectangles and a polynomial funtion. It also uses the turtle module to generate a graph showing the polynomial function's graph and the rectangles used for calculating the Riemann Sum (Area under the curve).
